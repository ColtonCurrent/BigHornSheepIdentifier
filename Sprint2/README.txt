Model:
The changes implemented this week came from including three classes of photos instead of two.
We also had to change our prediction and file reading script to allow for the writing of CSV files.
We included the training, testing, and prediction script but the main focus will be the training and prediction scripts.
We DID NOT include the photos as our client asked us not to share the ones they sent us.
