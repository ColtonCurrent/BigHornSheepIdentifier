For Sprint 1 you will need to look at MainWindow.xaml and MainWindow.xaml.cs for the front end code.
The backend will utlize the sprint1Test.py and the bighorn2.h5 model.
If you wish to run the application you will need to setup Visual Studio to utlize the .NET frame work. You then will have to potientally 
update the file paths in the C# code in case the paths mismatch your local python install and the python file.
